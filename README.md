With over 15 years as a developer and more than 20 years in the technology area, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãhardware and networks, today I intend to become Tech Lead and reach the position of CTO, where I can collaborate with the teams, and participate in all squads taking my knowledge acquired over the years, and learning from new generations.

Strengths: Determination, teamwork, patience, and ease of learning.

Skills: Agility in solving problems, integrating tools, innovation, consulting, application architecture, proactivity.

Areas of interest: Web/Mobile technologies, Game developer (possible career change)

I evolved a lot in my career, I went back to school and I'm finishing college, and I redid all my steps about what I should or shouldn't need to learn anymore, today I am different, and this has made me gain respect and admiration in the last 5 years. by the team, I worked for, which has been very close.

What people always tell me, and that there is nothing that I can‚Äôt find a solution for, I don‚Äôt give up on any challenge.
